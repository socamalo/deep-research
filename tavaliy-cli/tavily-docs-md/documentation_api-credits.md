## [​](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-credits\#api-credits-costs)  API Credits Costs

### [​](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-credits\#tavily-search)  Tavily Search

Your [search depth](https://docs.tavily.com/api-reference/endpoint/search#body-search-depth) determines the cost of your request.

- **Basic Search (`basic`):**
Each request costs **1 API credit**.
- **Advanced Search (`advanced`):**
Each request costs **2 API credits**.

### [​](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-credits\#tavily-extract)  Tavily Extract

The number of successful URL extractions and your [extraction depth](https://docs.tavily.com/api-reference/endpoint/extract#body-extract-depth) determines the cost of your request. You never get charged if a URL extraction fails.

- **Basic Extract (`basic`):**
Every 5 successful URL extractions cost **1 API credit**
- **Advanced Extract (`advanced`):**
Every 5 successful URL extractions cost **2 API credits**

### [​](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-credits\#tavily-map)  Tavily Map

The number of pages mapped and whether or not natural-language [instructions](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-reference/endpoint/map#instructions) are specified determines the cost of your request. You never get charged if a map request fails.

- **Regular Mapping:**
Every 10 successful pages returned cost **1 API credit**
- **Map with (`instructions`):**
Every 10 successful pages returned cost **2 API credits**

### [​](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-credits\#tavily-crawl)  Tavily Crawl

Tavily Crawl combines both mapping and extraction operations, so the cost is the sum of both:

- **Crawl Cost = Mapping Cost + Extraction Cost**

For example:

- If you crawl 10 pages with basic extraction depth, you’ll be charged **1 credit for mapping** (10 pages) + **2 credits for extraction** (10 successful extractions ÷ 5) = **3 total credits**
- If you crawl 10 pages with advanced extraction depth, you’ll be charged **1 credit for mapping** \+ **4 credits for extraction** = **5 total credits**

### [​](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-credits\#tavily-research)  Tavily Research

Tavily Research follows a dynamic
pricing model with minimum and maximum credit consumption boundaries associated
with each request. The minimum and maximum boundaries differ based on if the
request uses `model=mini` or `model=pro`.

| Request Cost Boundaries | model=pro | model=mini |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Per-request minimum | 15 credits | 4 credits |
| Per-request maximum | 250 credits | 110 credits |
