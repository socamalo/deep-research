[​](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-reference/endpoint/search#authorization-authorization)

Authorization

string

header

required

Bearer authentication header in the form Bearer , where  is your Tavily API key (e.g., Bearer tvly-YOUR\_API\_KEY).

#### Body

application/json

Parameters for the Tavily Search request.

[​](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-reference/endpoint/search#body-query)

query

string

required

The search query to execute with Tavily.

Example:

`"who is Leo Messi?"`

[​](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-reference/endpoint/search#body-search-depth)

search\_depth

enum<string>

default:basic

Controls the latency vs. relevance tradeoff and how `results[].content` is generated:

- `advanced`: Highest relevance with increased latency. Best for detailed, high-precision queries. Returns multiple semantically relevant snippets per URL (configurable via `chunks_per_source`).
- `basic`: A balanced option for relevance and latency. Ideal for general-purpose searches. Returns one NLP summary per URL.
- `fast`: Prioritizes lower latency while maintaining good relevance. Returns multiple semantically relevant snippets per URL (configurable via `chunks_per_source`).
- `ultra-fast`: Minimizes latency above all else. Best for time-critical use cases. Returns one NLP summary per URL.

Cost:

- `basic`, `fast`, `ultra-fast`: 1 API Credit
- `advanced`: 2 API Credits

See [Search Best Practices](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/best-practices/best-practices-search#search-depth) for guidance on choosing the right search depth.

Available options:

[​](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-reference/endpoint/search#body-auto-parameters)

auto\_parameters

boolean

default:false

When `auto_parameters` is enabled, Tavily automatically configures search parameters based on your query's content and intent. You can still set other parameters manually, and your explicit values will override the automatic ones. The parameters `include_answer`, `include_raw_content`, and `max_results` must always be set manually, as they directly affect response size. Note: `search_depth` may be automatically set to advanced when it's likely to improve results. This uses 2 API credits per request. To avoid the extra cost, you can explicitly set `search_depth` to `basic`.

[​](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-reference/endpoint/search#body-exact-match)

exact\_match

boolean

default:false

Ensure that only search results containing the exact quoted phrase(s) in the query are returned, bypassing synonyms or semantic variations. Wrap target phrases in quotes within your query (e.g. `"John Smith" CEO Acme Corp`). Punctuation is typically ignored inside quotes.

[​](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-reference/endpoint/search#body-include-usage)

include\_usage

boolean

default:false

Whether to include credit usage information in the response.
